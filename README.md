# Cybersecurity with Python ‚Äî Part 4: Detecting Threats in Apache Logs

In the evolving landscape of cybersecurity, visibility into your systems is everything. One of the most valuable and often underutilized resources in a defender‚Äôs toolkit is the web server access log. This project demonstrates how to use Python to analyze Apache access logs to detect early signs of malicious activity such as scanning, brute-force attempts, and suspicious traffic bursts.

## Why Apache Logs?

Apache HTTP Server logs every request made to your web server ‚Äî including IP addresses, timestamps, requested URLs, response codes, and user agents. These logs contain all the clues needed to hunt for threats like credential brute-force attempts, URL fuzzing/scanning, or malware probes.

Example Apache log entry:

```

83.149.9.216 - - [17/May/2015:10:05:03 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 1234

```

## Threat Detection Logic

This project focuses on detecting IP addresses that make **more than 10 requests within a one-minute window** ‚Äî a common indicator of automated scanning or brute-force attack scripts.

---

## How It Works: Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Load the log file:** Read the Apache access log line by line.  
2. **Extract IP and timestamp:** Use a regex pattern to extract the client IP address and the time of each request.  
3. **Group requests by IP:** Store all timestamps for each IP address.  
4. **Detect rapid requests:**  
   - Sort timestamps for each IP.  
   - Check if any consecutive 10 requests happen within 60 seconds.  
   - Flag such IPs as suspicious.

## Python Script

```

import re
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from collections import defaultdict

# 1. Load logs from file

def load_logs(file_path):
with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
return f.readlines()

# 2. Parse IPs and timestamps

def parse_logs(log_lines):

    pattern = re.compile(r'(?P<ip>\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+).*?$(?P<datetime>[^$]+)$$')
    ip_timestamps = defaultdict(list)
    
    for line in log_lines:
        match = pattern.search(line)
        if match:
            ip = match.group('ip')
            dt_str = match.group('datetime').split()  # remove timezone
            dt_obj = datetime.strptime(dt_str, "%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S")
            ip_timestamps[ip].append(dt_obj)
    
    return ip_timestamps
    
# 3. Detect IPs with 10+ requests in 1 minute

def detect_suspicious_ips(ip_timestamps):
print("\nüîç Potential scanning or brute-force behavior detected:\n")
for ip, times in ip_timestamps.items():
times.sort()
for i in range(len(times) - 9):
if times[i+9] - times[i] <= timedelta(minutes=1):
print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  IP {ip} made 10+ requests between {times[i]} and {times[i+9]}")
break

# 4. Main execution

if __name__ == "__main__":
logs = load_logs("apache_logs.txt")
ip_data = parse_logs(logs)
detect_suspicious_ips(ip_data)

```

---

## Explanation

- The regex extracts IP addresses and timestamps from each log line.
- Timestamps are parsed into Python `datetime` objects for accurate time comparison.
- The script checks if any IP has made **10 or more requests within any 60-second window**.
- Such behavior is flagged as suspicious, indicating possible brute-force or scanning activity.

## Sample Output

```

‚ö†Ô∏è  IP 83.149.9.216 made 10+ requests between 2015-05-17 10:05:03 and 2015-05-17 10:05:57

```

## Understanding the Apache Log Entry

A sample log line:

```

83.149.9.216 - - [17/May/2015:10:05:03 +0000] "GET /resource/path HTTP/1.1" 200 1234 "http://referrer" "User-Agent string"

```

- **IP Address:** The client‚Äôs IP (e.g., 83.149.9.216)  
- **User Identity and Authenticated User:** Often reported as `-` if not applicable  
- **Timestamp:** Date and time of the request with timezone  
- **Request:** HTTP method, resource path, and protocol  
- **Status Code:** Server response code (e.g., 200)  
- **Response Size:** Size of server response in bytes  
- **Referrer:** The URL of the referring webpage  
- **User-Agent:** Client software identification string

---

## Usage Notes

- Use publicly available sample logs to test, like [Elastic‚Äôs Apache logs dataset](https://github.com/elastic/examples/tree/master/Common%20Data%20Formats/apache_logs).  
- Detect suspicious IPs early and augment with threat intelligence checks.  
- Follow incident response protocols on confirmed threats.

---

## Conclusion

This Python-based approach provides a straightforward and effective way to detect suspicious behavior in Apache access logs, helping defenders take early action against automated attacks like brute-force scans and fuzzing.
